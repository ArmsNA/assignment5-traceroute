### For anyone experience issues running their traceroute.py program on Windows 10 and 11, specifically getting timeout printed for all intermediary routers, your solution is here at last! It appears that a new Windows update is blocking some of the ICMP traffic required for the lab to be tested locally.
### Provided is a script and instructions.
### The instructions are just to help you execute the powershell script in order to fix this issue so you can better test your programs locally!

# traceroute.ps1 Powershell Script Instructions:
## *For Windows 10 and 11 users experiencing “timeouts” for all intermediary routers 
1. Navigate to your Windows search bar and type “powershell” 
2. Right Click “Windows Powershell” and left click on “Run as administrator” 
3. Assuming you downloaded traceroute.ps1 into your “Downloads” directory use the following command: 
`cd C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Downloads`
4. Finally use the next command to execute the script:
`./traceroute.ps1`
5. This should create the required firewall rules to allow your python traceroute program to receive all the ICMP packets required for the lab.
